# BringATrailerWebScraper
I occasionally head over to bringatrailer.com to daydream about snagging a classic Mercedes or BMW from the '90s or earlier, especially if it's under 20 grand. Honestly, I'm not really planning to buy one right now, but it's fun to look. The thing is, the site's filtering isn't super helpful, so it used to be a bit of a drag wading through everything to find the gems that fit what I'm after. So, what did I do? I whipped up a web scraper that goes through all the current auctions on the site, weeds out the rides that don't tick my boxes, and then it dumps the ones that do into a CSV file. Plus, it pops open all the car links in my browser, which is pretty sweet. Building it was a blast and now I don't have to waste time scrolling past cars I don't care about!
