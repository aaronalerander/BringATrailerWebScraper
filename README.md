# BringATrailerWebScraper
Every once in a while I like to go on bringatrailer.com and fantasize about buying for a pre-2000s Mercedes Benz or BMW that is under $20,000 (although I have no intention of buying one at the moment). bringatrailer.com only has a one attribute filter for its auctions, so it is a very tedious process scrolling though all the auctions to find the vehicles that meet my requirements. The web scraper I built scraps bringatrailer.com for all the current auctions and filters out the vehicles that don't meet my requirements, then writes those vehicles information to a CSV file and also opens all the car links in my browser. It was fun to build and now I don't have to spend time scrolling through vehicles I'm not interested in!
